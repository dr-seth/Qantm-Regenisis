# Discovery-Generated Trading Strategies

## Overview

This directory contains trading strategies automatically generated by AARA's Discovery Engine through evolutionary optimization and hypothesis testing.

## How Strategies Are Generated

1. **Hypothesis Generation**: AARA's Discovery Engine identifies potential trading opportunities based on market patterns, cross-domain insights, and historical data analysis.

2. **Strategy Evolution**: Candidate strategies are evolved using genetic algorithms, optimizing for risk-adjusted returns while maintaining GLASSBOX compliance.

3. **Backtesting Validation**: Each strategy undergoes rigorous backtesting with realistic execution simulation before being added to this directory.

4. **Lineage Tracking**: All strategies maintain full lineage tracking to their discovery process, including:
   - Source hypotheses
   - Evolution history
   - Backtesting results
   - Data dependencies

## Strategy Naming Convention

Generated strategies follow the naming pattern:
```
{discovery_date}_{strategy_type}_{unique_id}.py
```

Example: `20260206_momentum_a1b2c3d4.py`

## Deployment Workflow

1. Strategy is generated and validated by Discovery Engine
2. Strategy file is created in this directory
3. Strategy is registered in the strategy registry
4. Strategy enters paper trading for live validation
5. Upon successful paper trading, strategy may be promoted to live trading

## Safety Considerations

- All generated strategies must pass Safety Kernel validation
- Risk parameters are enforced by the execution framework
- Strategies can be automatically disabled if performance degrades
